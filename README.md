### Security

> Security and compliance review
> 
> All Zoom Marketplace apps are subject to a security and compliance audit encompassing a multi-part review intended to maintain customer security, integrity and resilience of the ecosystem as a whole.
> 
> Once you have submitted your app for review, after a successful functional review and prior to the publication of your app on the Zoom App Marketplace, the App Security team at Zoom will conduct a security and compliance review of your app.
> 
> The App Security team may, in its discretion, communicate with you regarding changes that you might have to make in order for your app to pass the security review; provided, however, that the results of the security review are confidential and may not be shared with third parties without Zoom’s prior written consent. Your app will not be approved on the Zoom App Marketplace unless it passes the security and compliance review.
